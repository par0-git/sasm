# sasm
SemiAssembly / sasm: a very experimental assembly-like language

## What is SemiAssembly?
####In theory, SemiAssembly is a programming language made to be low-level(ish) without being annoying.
####The primary purpose of the language will be for very small-scale scripting (like conversations in games), where the simple syntax will keep code clean and concise.
In practice, sasm is barely a language yet. 
The parts needed to interpret and compile the language are still under development. For more information, refer to **Parts of SemiAssembly**.

## Parts of SemiAssembly
SemiAssembly goes from *SASM code* to *SASM byte code*, where it can be either interpreted or compiled into *native code*.
Development of the interpreter / VM is currently underway.
